# <Accessability for Horiseon>

## Description

In order to make the Horiseon company website more accessiible for users with vision loss we utilized semantic coding practices to allow for screen reader optimiazation. We used alternative tags to identify all images and include decriptive notes on all visual elements throughout the site. Code was organized in a logical way in order to create a cohesive mental image. This coding complies with ADA Standards in an attempt to provide accessability to all indivudals.

## Installation

Users will require a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft edge, or safari. 
Users will require a screen reader, such as Chrome Vox or Apple VoiceOver in order to experience the full effects of the semantic coding. 

## Usage
To best use the semantic feature on this project, navigate to the website, open Chrome DevTools, and have your screenreader read the code out loud.
